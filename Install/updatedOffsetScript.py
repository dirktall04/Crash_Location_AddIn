# Rebuild the accident offset script to use a fixed source of Roadway data (NG911) and just select it by associated County or Counties.
# It's okay to select two or three PSAPs for a particular county if that's what's needed. The selection just reduces the running
# time a bit and the possibility for errors a little.
